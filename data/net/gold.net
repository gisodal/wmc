Now walk over to the door and block it.\r\n\r\nAn official now opens one of the other two doors. This door has NOT been hiding the gold.\r\n\r\nWe are now left with two doors, and the gold is behind one of these.\r\n\r\nThe question now is: What are the probabilities for the gold being behind the door you chose in step 1, and the second door the official didn't open???\r\n\r\nWould you say 1/2 and 1/2 ??, then you are wrong.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTo run the network, enter your bet in the 'Your-D' node. Enter the choice of the official in the 'Ofcl-D' node and watch the 'Gold' node, that indicates the probabilities for each door.\r\n\r\n--------";
